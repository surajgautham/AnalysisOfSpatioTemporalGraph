# AnalysisOfSpatioTemporalGraph

We are utilizing the England COVID dataset, which is considered a benchmark dataset in PyTorch Geometric Temporal dataset. This dataset contains information on the movement and past cases of COVID-19 in England's NUTS3 regions from March 3 to May 12. The dataset is broken down by day, and the graph is directed and weighted. The graph indicates how many people moved from one region to the other each day, based on Facebook Data For Good disease prevention maps. The node features represent the number of COVID-19 cases in the area over the past eight days. The objective is to anticipate the number of cases in each node after one day. Self-loops on the graph demonstrate the number of individuals who remained in the same location and did not travel elsewhere. Our task is to predict the number of cases in a specific location by analyzing the movement of people from one place to another and taking into account the current number of COVID-19 cases in that area and the node feature, which indicates the number of cases in that location over the last few days.Since COVID-19 has a period of incubation, it is critical to know the number of cases in the preceding few days. We use various techniques with and without hyperparameter tuning to obtain results from the test dataset. We compare these results to determine which approach produces the most optimal outcomes, gaining insight into the effectiveness of each method.
